Okay, so today we are gonna go over how to do a basic standing barbell curl. Obviously it's to work the biceps. Now with the bar, you have different choices. There's an easy curl bar, which is the zig zag bar. Or you can use the straight bar. Both are just as efficient as the other. So, to start out with this exercise, what you wanna do; always start with your base, your feet. Make sure they, your knees are nice and loose, not locked out. And make sure that your arms are nice and loose, not locked out. And what I mean by locked out is you never wanna lock your elbow out, cause that could damage the joint. You always keep a soft elbow, slightly bent, no matter what, through your entire rep, and the entire set. So during this exercise, the hard part, the positive part; is coming up, squeeze, come back down through the negative. Always want to keep control of this exercise. You see a lot of guys with bad habits, throwing the bar up, letting the bar drop; doing nothing for themselves. So, the more concentrated you are on the bicep, the better results you are gonna get. So its up, squeeze. Back down. Notice my elbows are not coming all the way forward. You don't want to have to be picking up your arm like this. Cause then your are taking away from the bicep work. Its elbows remain locked in place. Bier side, come up squeeze, control back down. Control the negative. Breathing wise, when you get really taxed, you wanna make sure that you are breathing through the, all of your exercise. So you always breath out during the hard part, when you are working against gravity. So it's up, breathe out. Remember to squeeze that bicep at the top. Inhale on the way down. Come up squeeze, inhale on the way down. And that's your basic bicep exercise. Basic straight barbell curl.
